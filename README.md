# kaarx's dotfiles

This repository is a copy of my dotfiles. I've currently got dotfiles spread over various instances of macos and linux, and I'm going to start centralising them here.

I'm going to use the technique outlined in [this post](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/)

## Installation

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaarx/dotfiles/master/dots-install | sh
```
